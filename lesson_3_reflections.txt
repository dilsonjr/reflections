When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we would like to share files or colaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may want to select what changes you bring into your repository, based on possible updates made by other people

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks we use when we want to duplicate a repository in the GitHub. clone can be used when we want to duplicate a repository from a remote or locally, and branch we use when we want to start a new version of the file, preserving the previous versions 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote will allow us to continue working on our local state and merge it when we are ready
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Would collaborate by saving different versions of files, with different file titles and exchanging files via email. It would be much harder to keep tract than Git and GitHub. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Master has to be always deployable. Working on separate branches will protect master from the risk of inserting bugs or problems into master, while we are working on a fix or feature
